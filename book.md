> Gabriel Peyré and Marco Cuturi, [Computational Optimal Transport](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rp6lyoun6dbrbrs/OTFNT.pdf?dl=0), 2017.

This book reviews OT with a bias toward numerical methods and their applications in data sciences, and sheds lights on the theoretical properties of OT that make it particularly useful for some of these ap- plications. Our focus is on the recent wave of efficient algorithms that have helped translate attractive theoretical properties onto elegant and scalable tools for a wide variety of applications. We also give a prominent place to the many generalizations of OT that have been proposed in but a few years, and connect them with related approaches originating from statistical inference, kernel methods and information theory.
