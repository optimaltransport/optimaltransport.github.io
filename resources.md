Reproducing the Figures of the Book
-------------------

The Matlab code to reproduce most of the figures of the book [is available online](https://github.com/optimaltransport/optimaltransport.github.io/tree/master/code).


Other Resources
-------------------

- [Sinkhorn solver](http://marcocuturi.net/SI.html) by Marco Cuturi.
- [The numerical Tours of Signal Processing](http://www.numerical-tours.com) (in Matlab and Python) contains a section dedicated to the basics of computational optimal transport (linear solver, entropic regularization, applications to imaging sciences).
- [Python Optimal Transport Library](https://github.com/rflamary/POT): This open source Python library provide several solvers for optimization problems related to Optimal Transport for signal, image processing and machine learning.
- Unbalanced Transport [in Matlab](https://github.com/gpeyre/2017-MCOM-unbalanced-ot), [in Julia](https://github.com/lchizat/optimal-transport), [and python (including space and multiscale)](https://github.com/bernhard-schmitzer/optimal-transport): codes to solve entropic OT, barycenters, gradient flows, with mass variation.
